# Cache Simulator

This was a project for my CS 3810 class at the University of Utah, where were asked to simulate 3 types of caches (direct mapped, set associative, fully associative) in a CPU. I chose to use .NET Framework and C# to do this. The program is just a simple console application that will run and output the numbers from the cache based on the parameters of the functions. The code is messy and doesn't use good software engineering principles in many places, but it was only intended to be an experimental program of sorts, so I didn't put too much thought into making it readable. It was a fun project however, and it was good to get some experience using .NET outside of Visual Studio's environemnt in Windows.
